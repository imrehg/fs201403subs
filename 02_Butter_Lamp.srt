1
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:17,280
Hold your head up straight.
Yes, like that.

2
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:22,975
One, two, three

3
00:01:24,996 --> 00:01:27,985
Ok, great.
Now we'll change the background.

4
00:01:28,164 --> 00:01:30,164
Go and change it.
OK.

5
00:01:36,995 --> 00:01:38,995
Gently does it.

6
00:01:50,992 --> 00:01:52,992
Yes, that's good.

7
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:55,036
Is that OK?
It's fine.

8
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:57,009
OK, everyone, look this way.

9
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,051
Hey, little boy, over here!

10
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:04,095
One, two, three.

11
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:14,123
OK, that's good.

12
00:02:14,196 --> 00:02:17,104
Now for the next lot.
Come on.

13
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:22,190
Print out their photo for them.

14
00:02:23,089 --> 00:02:24,038
OK.

15
00:02:27,122 --> 00:02:29,222
Here, this is for the photo

16
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,110
Right then

17
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:41,010
Two...
And this...

18
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:45,987
That makes 17.
Come on, let's go.

19
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,152
Ah, the stool.

20
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:53,019
17 yuan, it's expensive!
Petrol, paper, ink. Everything's gone up.

21
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:57,006
 OK, I'm ready.

22
00:02:58,073 --> 00:02:59,506
Everything except incomes!

23
00:03:00,229 --> 00:03:01,236
Shall we do it, then?

24
00:03:03,009 --> 00:03:04,980
No, wait. You two change places.

25
00:03:05,019 --> 00:03:07,791
You there and you here.

26
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,988
We can't see you… That's better.

27
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:19,020
That's it.

28
00:03:20,055 --> 00:03:21,075
Shall we do it?

29
00:03:22,023 --> 00:03:23,055
Hurry up!

30
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:25,009
Oh, him too.

31
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,990
Take his work jacket off.

32
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,102
Give that here.

33
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,151
- How's this?
- Yes, it's better.

34
00:03:47,139 --> 00:03:48,183
Ah, the little one.

35
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,992
Careful now, be gentle.

36
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:58,023
Hold him tight.

37
00:03:58,212 --> 00:04:01,140
Maybe not that tight.
No, not like that.

38
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
Gently and higher up.
That’s good.

39
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:07,186
Everyone, look over here.

40
00:04:08,223 --> 00:04:11,214
One, two, three

41
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,220
Grandaad.

42
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:21,230
-Can you wear this?
-Yes

43
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:26,074
- Can you try it for size?
- It'll be fine.

44
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,145
A top-of-the-range jacket!

45
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,118
There.

46
00:04:42,096 --> 00:04:45,112
Here, son, can you wear this?
Try it on.

47
00:04:57,218 --> 00:04:59,005
Or, if not that...

48
00:05:00,115 --> 00:05:02,065
Herem have this one.

49
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:07,219
Gongbo! Gongbo...

50
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:12,060
Too bad for him. Come back.

51
00:05:21,016 --> 00:05:24,006
It doesn't matter.
Stand there. OK, that's good.

52
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:29,213
Everyone, look at me.
Little one, look over here.

53
00:05:30,174 --> 00:05:32,037
Look at me!

54
00:05:33,135 --> 00:05:34,169
This way.

55
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:38,112
One, two, three.

56
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,115
- Where did you get the beads?
- Lhassa.

57
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,115
Youngsters don't wear old clothes
any more, like the kid earlier.

58
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:56,033
His mother made it for him.
Now she's dead, he always wears it.

59
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:06,977
Help me with this tie, my friend.
OK.

60
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:16,036
Come on.

61
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:25,218
The knot should be inside. There.

62
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:32,002
- How's that?
- Perfect.

63
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:39,949
A bit more this way.
And you, in the middle.

64
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:42,105
The flower.

65
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,993
Now, both of you, look over here.

66
00:06:57,236 --> 00:06:59,861
Look over here.
Hey!

67
00:07:02,017 --> 00:07:05,173
- Mr Mayor, a cigarette?
- No, thanks.

68
00:07:07,167 --> 00:07:10,010
As you're all here,
I have some announcements.

69
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:16,010
For the New Socialist Campaign,
the authorities will be visiting us.

70
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,146
Everyone must clean their home,
inside and out.

71
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:28,107
Also, a sacred yak belonging
to Lahmo Tso has been stolen.

72
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,958
There must be strangers around.
We'll investigate it.

73
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:45,012
Goodbye!

74
00:07:46,222 --> 00:07:48,110
Wait!

75
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:10,036
Come and sit here.

76
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:14,200
- The motorbike's a good idea.
- Yes, it’s brand-new.

77
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,029
There's a flower there.
Put it on the motorbike.

78
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:25,011
- You have lots of props.
- It's my job.

79
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:27,175
- You like that?
- Yes.

80
00:08:28,173 --> 00:08:30,161
Knot it underneath.

81
00:08:34,048 --> 00:08:35,117
Perfect.

82
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:38,153
Look over here, both of you.

83
00:08:39,119 --> 00:08:41,119
And smile. That's it.

84
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:44,001
One, two, three.

85
00:09:01,126 --> 00:09:03,051
Hey, clear off!

86
00:09:06,228 --> 00:09:09,021
Hold it in your hand.

87
00:09:10,069 --> 00:09:12,143
You too, hold it like that.

88
00:09:15,171 --> 00:09:17,046
Look over here.

89
00:09:18,069 --> 00:09:19,091
Over here!

90
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:20,107
One, two...

91
00:09:22,002 --> 00:09:24,002
- No, don't!
- Don’t take it off him.

92
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:27,003
Don't do that again.
Look over here.

93
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,179
Keep still.

94
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:33,049
One, two, three.

95
00:09:40,199 --> 00:09:42,037
Come on, clear off!

96
00:09:43,147 --> 00:09:44,233
You too, over here!

97
00:09:46,227 --> 00:09:49,013
Go and look at yourself
on the photos.

98
00:09:53,124 --> 00:09:55,199
- Ah, here's Grandma!
- Yes.

99
00:09:56,047 --> 00:09:58,197
This is Ama Lhamo Tso.
I mentioned her earlier.

100
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:01,233
She's never
been photographed before.

101
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:06,163
- We'll make it special.
- Do you have other backgrounds?

102
00:10:07,012 --> 00:10:08,199
Of course.
Bring the catalogue.

103
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,041
- Come and see.
- OK.

104
00:10:16,007 --> 00:10:19,000
- This one?
- It's nice, but not for her.

105
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:24,147
- Or this?
- Yes, that's good.

106
00:10:27,187 --> 00:10:29,187
Lower that one.

107
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:34,222
- The motorbike was nice of you.
- It was no big deal.

108
00:10:35,145 --> 00:10:38,065
- What village are you from?
- I'm from here.

109
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:41,140
How many people live in the village?

110
00:10:42,026 --> 00:10:45,125
- 248 households.
- That's a lot.

111
00:10:46,048 --> 00:10:49,063
But the youngsters
all go off to town to work.

112
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,032
- How's that?
- Yes, perfect.

113
00:10:53,043 --> 00:10:56,146
It's her dream
to visit Potala Palace one day.

114
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:02,165
When the road's finished
it'll be easier to get here.

115
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,217
Yes, we'll save over ten hours.

116
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:07,228
- When will it be finished?
- By spring.

117
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:12,032
Oh, no, she's prostrating herself!
Up you get, Grandma.

118
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:19,008
Here, I'll take your prayer wheel.

119
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,030
Help her to get up.
That's good.

120
00:11:35,077 --> 00:11:39,155
- Now sit down here.
- And look that way.

121
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:47,035
- Yes, this way.
- You have to look that way.

122
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,042
This way!

123
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:58,207
- You'll have to change the photo.
- Yes, change it.

124
00:12:02,406 --> 00:12:04,092
That's better, the ocean.

125
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:12,034
- The other way…
- You have to look the other way.

126
00:12:13,231 --> 00:12:15,243
Look at me, look at me.

127
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:19,086
Yes, look at him.

128
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:23,143
One, two, three.

129
00:12:32,037 --> 00:12:34,049
Shall I put the rolls in the truck?

130
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:36,162
Hang on, we'll take this one first.

131
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,056
Make sure it's well rolled first.

132
00:12:49,015 --> 00:12:51,040
Put it here for now.

133
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:54,000
Pack the clothes away now.

134
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,020
Hey, kid, how are you?

135
00:13:11,018 --> 00:13:13,080
- Are you passing by Lhassa? 
- Yes.

136
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:18,205
Take this butter to Potala Palace,
as an offering for my mother.

137
00:13:19,013 --> 00:13:21,013
- Yes, I promise I'll do it.
- Thank you.

138
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:36,216
- Have you got all the props.
- Yeah, got them.

139
00:13:37,127 --> 00:13:42,210
Put them away tidily,
so they're ready when we need them.

140
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,710


141
00:13:47,028 --> 00:13:49,016
There, that's good.

142
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:56,233
- Where do I put them all?
- In a box, so they don't break.

143
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:02,047
We'd better hurry
before they block the road.

144
00:14:02,148 --> 00:14:06,690
- Why are they working at night?
- To be ready for the authorities.

145
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,032
- Shall we stop in Kang Ba to sleep?
- Yes.

146
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,063
- We mustn't forget the kid's butter.
- No, no.
