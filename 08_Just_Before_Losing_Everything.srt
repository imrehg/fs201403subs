1
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:48,891
Sally!

2
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:00,449
Be good.

3
00:01:27,972 --> 00:01:29,081
Where are you going?

4
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:33,299
I have to get some cigarettes for my dad.

5
00:01:33,686 --> 00:01:36,693
Hurry then Julien.
We have a test this morning.

6
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:39,198
By the way, are your parents coming
 to the class meeting on Friday?

7
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:42,457
Hurry up!

8
00:03:46,915 --> 00:03:48,681
Put your seatbelt on, please.

9
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:01,706
Did you get my cigaretters?

10
00:06:07,225 --> 00:06:08,444
Thanks.

11
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:16,710
Hi Miriam.

12
00:07:22,022 --> 00:07:24,844
Didier, can I leave the kids with you?

13
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:27,325
- What's going on?
- I won't be long.

14
00:07:27,736 --> 00:07:28,947
Of course.

15
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,185
What's the rush?

16
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,149
Register 2 at noon, register 3...

17
00:07:36,357 --> 00:07:39,052
- Alarm didn't go off?
- Car trouble again.

18
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:41,427
I need to talk to Gaëlle.

19
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,627
- Hang on.
- Can I talk to you a minute?

20
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:48,557
Sorry.
I'm handing you over to Rofia.

21
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,979
There's a void at Fatou’s register.

22
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,019
- Ask Robocop.
- She's not in yet.

23
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:55,494
I'll be quick. Wait for me here.

24
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:57,892
- In the locker room?
- OK.

25
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:06,978
What's going on?

26
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:09,890
- I need to see Savelli.
- He's in a meeting.

27
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,118
- I brought the kids.
- What?

28
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:15,284
 I don't know what to do.
I must get out quick.

29
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,050
It's going to be fine.
It's not a big deal.

30
00:08:29,589 --> 00:08:32,079
Ask Rofia.
I have to do something.

31
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:35,582
You choose... It's simple.

32
00:08:35,847 --> 00:08:38,001
You choose... Wait, I'll show you.

33
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:39,629
Choose a weapon: a sword...

34
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:42,234
Hi kids.
Everything alright, Didier?

35
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,148
Great.

36
00:08:43,921 --> 00:08:45,552
And that's your score.

37
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:48,584
She has a fever.

38
00:08:49,402 --> 00:08:52,052
I'm waiting for the doctor.
I'll let you know.

39
00:08:53,211 --> 00:08:55,211
Thank you. Bye.

40
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,440
Ah... Miriam.

41
00:09:08,854 --> 00:09:11,046
Tell them I'll only be a minute.

42
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:18,359
I'm sorry to take your time.

43
00:09:19,088 --> 00:09:22,998
It's short notice but Gaëlle explained.
How shall we proceed?

44
00:09:24,196 --> 00:09:25,610
I have no idea.

45
00:09:27,597 --> 00:09:30,654
Do you want to take some time?
Maybe a leave?

46
00:09:31,026 --> 00:09:32,797
No that's impossible I can't come back after
all that…

47
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:34,515
- Have you pressed charges?
- No.

48
00:09:34,827 --> 00:09:36,264
You should press charges.

49
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,412
You'll need a medical certificate
for your file.

50
00:09:39,902 --> 00:09:41,263
It's just that...

51
00:09:43,027 --> 00:09:45,913
I've got the kids
and we must leave quickly.

52
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:49,091
It would be great,
but Idon't have time.

53
00:09:49,162 --> 00:09:51,544
I see.
You're really leaving then?

54
00:09:57,009 --> 00:09:58,792
I'm in no rush to see you go!

55
00:10:03,557 --> 00:10:05,646
I can fire you
so you get your benefits.

56
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:07,827
But you'll have to come back
for an interview.

57
00:10:08,238 --> 00:10:09,508
Yes, I know.

58
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:11,641
Do you have a new address?

59
00:10:14,062 --> 00:10:16,722
I'm leaving town,
until things calm down.

60
00:10:16,743 --> 00:10:18,603
I don't know where I'm going yet.

61
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:21,117
We have two moths to do the interview.

62
00:10:21,207 --> 00:10:23,653
That's great...

63
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:29,948
It's just... I'm sorry but...
if I have to wait...

64
00:10:31,469 --> 00:10:34,244
What I mean is...
I'm going to need money.

65
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:42,980
No it's fine...

66
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,169
I'll give you my parents' address.

67
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:49,234
Accounting will give you an advance.

68
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,671
You can unblock the interest
on your shared profits.

69
00:10:53,012 --> 00:10:56,365
- For the rest, we'll do like we said.
- Thank you.

70
00:10:57,347 --> 00:10:59,218
I need to open my own account.

71
00:10:59,439 --> 00:11:00,421
Before you leave,

72
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:02,857
you really ought to press charges.

73
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:06,047
I'll come with you.
I'll go with her.

74
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,227
Thank you very much, Mr. Savelli.

75
00:11:11,032 --> 00:11:12,079
You need a place to stay?

76
00:11:12,093 --> 00:11:15,460
Thanks, but I'm going 
to my parents' or my sister's.

77
00:11:15,854 --> 00:11:18,434
- Where's your family?
- A 5 hour drive.

78
00:11:18,558 --> 00:11:19,747
You're up to it?

79
00:11:19,898 --> 00:11:22,697
I'm not taking the car.
We're still paying the loan.

80
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:24,843
- Does your family know?
- No.

81
00:11:25,089 --> 00:11:26,526
My sister... sort of.

82
00:11:27,499 --> 00:11:29,422
You have to do it, Miriam.

83
00:11:31,207 --> 00:11:33,732
I'm gonna ask my sister 
to pick us up.

84
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:48,314
Kids, Martine's going
to look after you,

85
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,908
and then take you to lunch.

86
00:11:50,374 --> 00:11:51,539
What about mom?

87
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:53,263
We have a couple of things to do

88
00:11:53,705 --> 00:11:55,667
but we might be back in time.

89
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:56,958
Come with me?

90
00:11:58,537 --> 00:12:00,127
Julien, get up.

91
00:12:01,648 --> 00:12:03,571
Where are your mom's things?

92
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:09,235
Everything OK?

93
00:12:10,457 --> 00:12:12,598
She's on the phone with her sister.

94
00:12:13,517 --> 00:12:16,175
The girl told me a little bit.
You knew?

95
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:17,961
Not to this extend.

96
00:12:20,665 --> 00:12:21,449
So?

97
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:24,575
She's coming with my brother.
They'll be here by 4.

98
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,151
OK. What do you want to wear?

99
00:12:26,507 --> 00:12:28,623
What you've got there.
I took what I could.

100
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:29,976
Get changed.

101
00:12:30,231 --> 00:12:32,643
Meet me downstairs.
I'll let Rofia know.

102
00:12:40,855 --> 00:12:42,121
- Try a little harder.
- May I?

103
00:12:42,527 --> 00:12:43,777
- Of course.
- Thanks.

104
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:46,835
- Miriam's kids?
- Yes.

105
00:12:47,664 --> 00:12:49,016
Hi, I'm Sophie.

106
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:51,973
Julien and Josephine.

107
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:59,314
- Not good?
- No, it's like at school.

108
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,970
They could try a little harder.

109
00:13:05,484 --> 00:13:06,671
You' re not hungry?

110
00:13:06,951 --> 00:13:08,735
She won't see her boyfriend again.

111
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,418
Shut up! OK?

112
00:13:10,855 --> 00:13:11,613
Where are you going?

113
00:13:11,968 --> 00:13:13,802
I'm going to the bathroom.

114
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:15,347
Hey, none of that.

115
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:17,283
OK?

116
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:20,210
Let's eat.

117
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:33,138
Robocop.

118
00:13:33,705 --> 00:13:34,584
Robocop? 

119
00:13:35,363 --> 00:13:38,914
It's Mrs. Bolocq, our supervisor.
She acts like a cop

120
00:13:39,189 --> 00:13:40,998
so we call her Robocop.
- She has a gun?

121
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:43,467
I wouldn't be surprised!

122
00:13:43,577 --> 00:13:45,717
We've got rifles at my house.

123
00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:48,876
They're my dad's. He hunts.

124
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,609
Do you go with him?

125
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:53,266
No. He goes with Sally, our dog.

126
00:13:53,891 --> 00:13:55,466
Sally likes to hunt?

127
00:13:55,614 --> 00:13:57,614
She barks when dad gets rifle.

128
00:13:57,998 --> 00:13:58,845
The whole time?

129
00:13:59,277 --> 00:14:00,118
Yeah.

130
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:04,465
She didn't even stop
when he aimed at mom.

131
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:13,754
Sally's a pretty name.

132
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,014
Where are the kids?

133
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:21,447
On the sofa in the reception.

134
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,929
She won't even press charges.

135
00:14:39,057 --> 00:14:41,057
Honey... Wake up,

136
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:43,352
we are living soon.

137
00:14:47,408 --> 00:14:48,313
Reception.

138
00:14:50,632 --> 00:14:52,632
She's right here, I'll send her in.

139
00:14:53,043 --> 00:14:55,578
Miriam, the accountant is ready for you.

140
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:57,937
Thanks.
I have to do some paperwork,

141
00:14:58,871 --> 00:14:59,783
I'll be right back.

142
00:15:09,194 --> 00:15:09,777
Have a seat.

143
00:15:12,064 --> 00:15:14,941
Mr. Savelli asked me to do this
as fast as possible.

144
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:17,301
You have a new account?

145
00:15:18,287 --> 00:15:20,287
Do you have a number?

146
00:15:22,836 --> 00:15:23,759
Thanks.

147
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,700
Your co-workers
are going to miss their union rep.

148
00:15:39,002 --> 00:15:40,837
Read it before you sign.

149
00:15:44,763 --> 00:15:46,610
So what happened?

150
00:15:47,148 --> 00:15:47,884
What?

151
00:15:48,144 --> 00:15:49,483
You getting fire.

152
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,160
I was just wondering what happened.

153
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:55,271
Nothing major.
Let's not got into it.

154
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:58,556
I just can't stay.
It's all very sudden.

155
00:16:06,985 --> 00:16:10,220
Sorry, I have to answer.
I'll be right back.

156
00:16:14,911 --> 00:16:16,718
- Hi Sylvia.
- We're here.

157
00:16:17,232 --> 00:16:20,221
- Eric's filling up at the gas station.
- OK

158
00:16:20,294 --> 00:16:22,396
Should we meet by the main entrance?

159
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:25,339
Call us from the parking lot.

160
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:27,418
I'm finishing some paperwork.

161
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:29,374
Cut it out!
How was the traffic?

162
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:33,949
Fine. It'll be busier going back.
My phone's almost out of battery.

163
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,400
- Bye.
- See you in a bit.

164
00:16:37,572 --> 00:16:38,467
Get your stuff.

165
00:16:39,526 --> 00:16:41,526
Miriam, come here.

166
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:49,627
Sophie saw your husband 
in the store.

167
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,282
It's Sophie.

168
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,150
- He's looking for you.
- What?

169
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,760
He'll see you're not here.

170
00:16:59,882 --> 00:17:00,734
Calm down.

171
00:17:00,942 --> 00:17:02,622
Stay up there.

172
00:17:02,627 --> 00:17:04,022
I know. Don't worry.

173
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:06,427
- He's staring.
- What's he doing?

174
00:17:07,077 --> 00:17:09,671
He's seen me.
He's coming towards me.

175
00:17:09,806 --> 00:17:11,310
- Don't look at him.
- I'm not.

176
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,570
Listen.
Tell him I'm in a staff meeting.

177
00:17:14,957 --> 00:17:17,831
If he insists,
pretend you're calling me

178
00:17:18,055 --> 00:17:20,991
in the conference room
and call me in Didier's office.

179
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:22,791
Yes. Bring the receipt.

180
00:17:23,437 --> 00:17:24,266
He's there?

181
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,311
It'll be OK,
he doesn;t know you're talking to me.

182
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:34,499
It's going to be fine.

183
00:17:34,706 --> 00:17:36,706
My pleasure. Bye now...

184
00:17:37,206 --> 00:17:38,987
- Hi Antoine.
- You OK?

185
00:17:39,145 --> 00:17:40,051
Where's Miriam?

186
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:43,766
- She's in a staff meeting.
- How long will it last?

187
00:17:43,876 --> 00:17:45,286
Yeah, a long time.

188
00:17:45,662 --> 00:17:46,403
Damn it!

189
00:17:46,837 --> 00:17:49,932
- Shall I take a message? 
- I really need to see her.

190
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:51,794
It's going to take a while.

191
00:17:52,941 --> 00:17:56,441
- You can't call her?
- She's in a meeting.

192
00:18:02,678 --> 00:18:05,729
Can you try? It's important.
I need two minutes.

193
00:18:06,082 --> 00:18:07,478
Just two minutes.

194
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:13,640
You've reached Sylvia.
Leave a message. I will call you back.

195
00:18:14,421 --> 00:18:18,804
Sylvia, it's me. He's here.
Idon't know what he wants.

196
00:18:19,163 --> 00:18:22,739
Stay at the gas station for now.

197
00:18:23,572 --> 00:18:27,441
If he sees you or your car
he'll figure everything out.

198
00:18:27,639 --> 00:18:30,474
Stay put for now.
I'll call you back.

199
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,256
It's Sophie again.

200
00:18:37,354 --> 00:18:39,444
Yes. OK, let me talk to him.

201
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:42,899
Yeah.

202
00:18:42,978 --> 00:18:44,360
What's the matter?

203
00:18:44,766 --> 00:18:48,599
I went to rent a sander.
But I realised you had the checkbook.

204
00:18:48,768 --> 00:18:50,475
I'm in a meeting.

205
00:18:50,859 --> 00:18:52,949
Great! What am I supposed to do?

206
00:18:56,121 --> 00:18:57,146
I'll bring it to you.

207
00:18:58,341 --> 00:18:59,478
What does he want?

208
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,513
No, mom! Don't go!

209
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,363
Julien, calm down.

210
00:19:03,854 --> 00:19:05,549
No! Don't go!

211
00:19:06,915 --> 00:19:08,355
Josephine, take your brother!

212
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:14,502
Miriam, you need to take
your problems elsewhere. 

213
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,347
He needs the checkbook.

214
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:36,119
Does he suspect something?

215
00:19:36,288 --> 00:19:37,564
- Should I come too?
- No!

216
00:19:38,292 --> 00:19:40,331
Call Eric and Sylvia.
They must wait.

217
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:46,668
Your name tag!

218
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:25,888
Hi.

219
00:20:40,469 --> 00:20:41,464
I forgot, I'm sorry.

220
00:20:41,758 --> 00:20:43,118
You working Friday?

221
00:20:43,468 --> 00:20:44,231
Yes. Why?

222
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:45,915
They changed my schemdule.

223
00:20:46,341 --> 00:20:49,926
I have to work,
I can't go to Julien's class meeting.

224
00:20:50,331 --> 00:20:52,001
Friday? I'll manage.

225
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:53,953
Mrs. Besson?
You weren't here this morning.

226
00:20:54,402 --> 00:20:55,058
Hello.

227
00:20:55,475 --> 00:20:56,380
Yes I was.

228
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:01,043
My colleague
will handle your return.

229
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:02,566
Thanks.

230
00:21:02,601 --> 00:21:04,882
Clara had to replace you
at register 21.

231
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:07,764
I was helping in children's clothing.

232
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:11,025
- You left your register.
- A void at cashier 17.

233
00:21:11,301 --> 00:21:13,759
- That's Gaëlle’s job
- She's on break.

234
00:21:13,865 --> 00:21:16,018
She's going to get an earful
from me.

235
00:21:19,284 --> 00:21:22,222
See you tonight.
I have to go back up.

236
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,567
I want to talk to you.
What time is your break?

237
00:21:26,169 --> 00:21:28,232
It depends on the meeting.

238
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,779
I'll wait here,
call me when you're done.

239
00:21:33,547 --> 00:21:35,572
OK, but it depends...

240
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:57,014
Excuse me. Warranties?

241
00:21:57,170 --> 00:21:59,474
- At the service desk, ma'am.
- Thank you.

242
00:22:23,066 --> 00:22:26,437
He's still in the store.
We have to go now. Your coat!

243
00:22:26,574 --> 00:22:28,033
- The uniform.
- What?

244
00:22:28,247 --> 00:22:30,427
We need the uniform back.

245
00:22:41,548 --> 00:22:42,684
Fuck.

246
00:22:48,417 --> 00:22:50,184
Sophie, it's Gaëlle.
Where is he?

247
00:22:52,231 --> 00:22:55,411
I haven't seen him leave.
He must be walking around.

248
00:22:59,635 --> 00:23:00,823
Come on1!

249
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:04,370
Didier!

250
00:23:08,903 --> 00:23:10,156
Let's go.

251
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,390
Wait here, I'll go to take a look.

252
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:54,618
Walk normally.

253
00:24:00,427 --> 00:24:02,427
It's clear, I didn't see him.

254
00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:46,807
Come on!

255
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,524
He's there!

256
00:25:21,621 --> 00:25:22,719
Are you leaving?

257
00:25:24,708 --> 00:25:25,594
Yes.
