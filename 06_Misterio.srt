OUT OF ORDER
Paco! You too? Out partying?

12
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,130
C'mon, mate!

13
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,260
Mari Tere told me...

14
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,400
she went to the pines
at the beach...

15
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,510
with Antonio and their little one,
José Manuel.

16
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:33,880
They saw a light in the distance
and went to see what it was.

17
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,910
As they got closer...

18
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,070
there was this smell of flowers
that became stronger.

19
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,140
They got to the rocks
in the pine grove.

20
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,490
It was all lit up.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,310
They saw the figure
of the Virgin Mary in the light.

22
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,570
Mari Tere says...

23
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:01,030
that the Virgin
pointed at José Manuel.

24
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,450
She was like that for a while,
then the lights disappeared.

25
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,380
She says that night...

26
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,920
the Virgin got into her son's body.

27
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:13,110
And they've found out...

28
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,150
if you put your ear
to the back of his neck,

29
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,500
you can hear the Virgin talk.

30
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,750
Don't threaten me! Don't!

31
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,410
Don't you dare!

32
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,640
How's things, Mari Carmen?

33
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,940
Getting by, Trini.

34
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,838
Your turn to clean the stairs
this week?

35
00:03:48,242 --> 00:03:49,446
Yes.

38
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:28,930
The mystery of the Virgin is
that she appears differently...

39
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,940
depending on who she talks to.

40
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,340
Me, I hear a young girl.

41
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,240
Others hear an old lady.

42
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,640
She can speak in Valencian...

43
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,760
But she's always like a mother...

44
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,780
and you sort of feel safe,
listening to her.

45
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,080
She gives you kitchen recipes,

46
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,670
tips for the home,

47
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,170
she tells you
what shops have discounts...

48
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,310
One day she told me:

49
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,690
40,099.

50
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:00,920
She just kept saying that.

51
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,100
So, I went to the newsagent's...

52
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,400
and saw that number there
on a lottery ticket.

53
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,340
I bought it...

54
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,130
but I didn't win nothing at all.

55
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:39,470
He wouldn't let me see other guys!

56
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:42,030
He won't leave me alone!

57
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,990
He claims you had sex with him...

58
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:48,250
STAIRS CLEANIN SHIFT

59
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,020
It's true!
You shut up, liar!

60
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:56,000
It's hot already.

61
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,120
Too hot.

62
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:08,250
Tomorrow's going to be even hotter.

63
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,880
And tomorrow's Saturday.

64
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,120
Trini!

65
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,820
Trini!

66
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,560
Mum!

67
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,580
Mari Carmen,

68
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,460
This letter is for José Vicente...

69
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:38,610
and for my José Luis,

70
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,480
who cannot read.

71
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,960
Don't try to find me
or worry about me.

72
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,950
It's hard to say good-bye.

73
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,760
But I'm really excited...

74
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,270
about what's going to happen to me.

75
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:56,710
What lives inside Mari Tere's son...

76
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:00,210
isn't the Virgin,
no matter what people say.

77
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,770
It's someone from far away.

78
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,980
And he told me...

79
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,710
that he can take me to his planet.

80
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,170
A million miles from Earth.

81
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,450
I had two dreams in life:

82
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,630
having cats
and travelling into space.

83
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,340
The first one can't be
as I'm allergic.

84
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,660
As for my other dream,
this miracle's happened.

85
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:26,350
I'm really going to miss you.

86
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,840
I might see you from above.

87
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,820
I'm not sure.

88
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,620
But just in case, be good.

89
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:37,430
I've left lots of food for you.

90
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,360
With all my love.

91
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,590
