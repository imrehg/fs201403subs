1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,269
What is that?

2
00:00:02,293 --> 00:00:06,972
Well, I just thought it would be good to start with like, a quote or something.

3
00:00:07,987 --> 00:00:09,987
Don't...., get rid of it, Idiot.

4
00:00:13,833 --> 00:00:18,970
Ladies and gentlemen, hello welcome to the Wednesday 
night open mic at the egg and sparrow

5
00:00:18,995 --> 00:00:23,969
we've a very special treat for you this evening, 
a chap giving his debut performance, 

6
00:00:23,994 --> 00:00:28,990
so please put your hands together and
 welcome onto the stage.... Mr Tom Moody.

7
00:00:50,008 --> 00:00:52,947
I'm Tom Moody..... 
And... Well. What?

8
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,998
Well, we can't both tell this..

9
00:00:56,023 --> 00:01:00,243
Absolutely, let me, I'm Tom Moody and 
this was the moment I knew for sure 

10
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:02,500
I was a deluded fool with no tal....

11
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:09,824
NO , that’s not true... I am Tom Moody 
and I've always loved making music.

12
00:01:10,055 --> 00:01:16,000
even as a little boy me and my cousin Steve would 
get together and make recordings of our songs....

13
00:01:16,019 --> 00:01:20,948
Oh please, the only thing Steve and 
me ever recorded is ourselves farting. 

14
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:25,988
Other than mums affair with the ice cream
 man my childhood was entirely unremarkable. 

15
00:01:25,996 --> 00:01:32,844
I was a dull and talentless child, I thank god that 
dad was there to rescue me from the last shambles  

16
00:01:32,869 --> 00:01:35,191
that me and Steve made of playing live

17
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:51,989
- Were the... the, ... witches of ...Halloween oooo , ooo, the....
 scaryest you've ever seen, 

18
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:57,960
- now to the G,
- we creep, cree....

19
00:01:57,964 --> 00:01:59,964
TO THE G CHORD!, oh for goodness sake, give it to me... 

20
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:05,265
we sneak up in the night and 
give you such a FRIGHT!.....

21
00:02:11,979 --> 00:02:14,083
We are the witches of Halloween...

22
00:02:22,004 --> 00:02:24,958
- Yes, but, we were ill prepared that time
- So, what's, that

23
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:27,947
We've had 32 years of practice since then, 
we can turn this around....

24
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:29,327
I don't want to turn..... 

25
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,232
Steve's the best keyboard player 
since flipping... Stevie wonder...

26
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:32,784
- Are you joking...
- Lets make it Big...

27
00:02:32,828 --> 00:02:35,115
- No!
- What about David Bowie?

28
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:37,383
- What about David Bowie!
- We could really rock them this time!

29
00:02:43,691 --> 00:02:46,994
It never sounded like this... 
This is ridiculous... 

30
00:02:48,596 --> 00:02:52,964
We don't have a guitar like that....
There were never any strings... 

31
00:02:54,013 --> 00:02:58,878
There was no one playing drums!
We never had backing singers...

32
00:03:00,684 --> 00:03:03,000
and Steve doesn't wear leopard skin pants.

33
00:03:14,918 --> 00:03:18,314
That's the thing about talent, 
you've either got it, or you've not... 

34
00:03:19,049 --> 00:03:23,977
Boring, in fact it's not just boring it's sad,
 you actually inspire sadness in people, 

35
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:26,955
you bring people down.... 
Moron, utter moron

36
00:03:26,985 --> 00:03:29,996
Ha! Ha,You should be ashamed, 
Why would anybody want to hear

37
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,733
SHUT UP!

38
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:46,952
I told you this was pointless, ruined it...
Shut up, please just shut up, or I’m going to

39
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:49,692
- Oh yeah, what you going to what? 
- I'm going to...

40
00:03:52,988 --> 00:03:54,508
Get off me.

41
00:04:01,932 --> 00:04:03,932
You!

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,961
Tom,I didn't know...

43
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:15,936
Tom?

44
00:04:39,768 --> 00:04:41,768
What is it Tom?

45
00:04:44,985 --> 00:04:46,985
I don't want us to sing.

46
00:04:50,001 --> 00:04:51,068
Why?

47
00:04:55,968 --> 00:04:58,072
People will think we're stupid and boring.

48
00:05:00,062 --> 00:05:05,007
Well, I don't think we're stupid and boring, 
and we don't have to do it for them, 

49
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:08,029
we can just, do it for us.

50
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:16,016
Do we have to sing the witches of Halloween?

51
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,974
We don't ever have to sing the witches of Halloween.

52
00:05:26,999 --> 00:05:28,055
- Ok

53
00:05:40,088 --> 00:05:48,843
- Like a bird, is born with a song, 

54
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:59,955
and like a song, wants to be sung...
